Writeup:

	For this particular project, we couldn't encode all of the variables of 
the dataset without losing the meaningful relationships of the data, so we decided 
to pick the variables that had the most meaning to us; in this case the nominal,
ordinal, and ratio values of the movies profits, budgets, year released, and IMBD 
rating. A bubble plot is appropriate for representing large datasets of mostly 
numerical data relationships between movies. The X-axis was used to order the 
movies by release year, the Y-axis was used to represent production budget, the 
size of the bubble was the profit, the intensity of the color of the bubble 
represents the IMDB rating, and inside the bubble is the actual name of the movie.
